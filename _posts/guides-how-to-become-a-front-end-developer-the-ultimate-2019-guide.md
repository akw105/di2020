If you have career dreams of being a Front-End developer but are unsure where to start, then this is the perfect guide for you. We’ll cover all the essential skills that you’ll need, how to get your own portfolio showcasing the best of your talents and even how to get the dreaded job search started.  


With its ever changing technologies and frameworks, it can be overwhelming knowing where to start out in front-end development. There are many paths and options available that all lead to a single destination of being a Front-End web developer.



You won’t become a Front-End developer overnight, it requires patience and dedication, but is totally possible to achieve, even if you’re working full time and hoping for a career change.



## What is a front-end developer?



To become a Front-End developer you need to understand exactly what one does and why.



If you head to any website, you will immediately be presented with the work of a Front-End developer. They are responsible for implementing what you see on a web page by using the three core Front-End developer languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A Back-End developer focusses on the technology serving the Front-End developers work.



Whilst Front-End development is one of the most accessible paths in web development, it can also be one of the most challenging which its constantly updating technologies and fast-paced environment.



This is why Front-End developers have to be open to constantly learning and adapting. This can be daunting to a beginner but after a year or so you should have enough background knowledge to be able to pick new things up easily and quickly, whilst identifying the right tools for the job at hand.



## Know why you want to become a Front-End developer



The journey to becoming a Front-End developer is a long one, and the learning curve can be very steep. Without struggle, there is no progress.



That shouldn't put you off, but during the tough times it's useful to have a reminder of why you are on this journey.



Do you want to get a better job? Would you like to build creative websites? Whatever your reason, figure it out and write it down on a sticky note to keep on your desk because it will come in handy in those days when you’re banging your head against a wall trying to figure something out.



It will be essential to your motivation to keep that reason in mind and stick with it.



## Essential skills for a front end developer



Knowing how to build a website is not the whole story when it comes to Front-End development. There are a whole load of extra skills that you are going to need, such as using the command line, learning git, testing, and performance.



There's also different tooling options available to help you enhance and automate your front-end development workflow but you'll come across these as you progress on your Front-End journey.



The best way to become a Front-End web developer is to set aside one or two hours every other day to learn, don't take too much on at once. Remember to take breaks and make sure that you really know the basics. Don't rush on to the next technology if you are struggling with another.



And perhaps most importantly, don’t be afraid to ask questions. Everyone was a beginner at some point but having the patience to stick it out and the courage to seek help will make your journey much, much smoother.



Before you begin:



This is a huge list of what you should know to be a Front-End web developer, but it's important to stress that you don't need to know everything.



It is 100% impossible to know everything about programming, browsers or devices.



Don’t put the burden of having to know everything on yourself, you will get burnt out and that is a horrible experience for anyone.



When it comes to front-end, HTML5 and CSS3 is enough to start but JavaScript is extra.



Become comfortable with the basics, then explore new areas, topics, and frameworks, do not try to learn everything.



Right, with that in mind, let's not drag this out any longer.

## This is how to become a Front-End developer without a degree in 2019!



### 1. Learn HTML. Seriously.



You can't escape this, HTML is the language that most websites are written with. The basics matter and thankfully HTML is pretty simple to learn. You should have a pretty good grasp within a week.



Do not pay to learn HTML. I repeat, do not pay to learn HTML.



You can do this for free in many places, I recommend going to Codecademy (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html) because they have an excellent interactive way of teaching and you'll get the bare basics in roughly 7 hours.



### 2. Learn basic CSS.



There's also no escaping this. CSS comes right after learning HTML because no one likes to look at blank pages.



Unlike HTML, there are many levels to CSS, you can learn the absolute basics for free at Codecademy (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css) in roughly 15 hours.





### 2.5. Learn the command line.



You may be wondering why you'd ever need to venture into the scary world of using the command line, but advanced CSS requires you to start learning to compile your code and this will give you an excellent head start.



It's actually much easier and quicker that it looks, you can complete the free Codecademy course in a matter of hours.



Not only does this help for CSS but this will also make learning version control a lot less daunting when you get to it.



### 3. Learn advanced CSS.



Don't get too comfy after completing your Codecademy CSS course, there's so much more to CSS that you have to know in order to become a Front-End web developer.



There are a couple of options how to proceed here but we strongly recommend this free Microsoft course (https://www.edx.org/course/advanced-css-concepts-3) or this excellent udemy video course (https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/) - note about this course, do not pay more than £12.99 for this, if the price is higher try visiting the website in incognito or try again in a weeks time.



You could also try this excellent free course from Wes Bos on mastering flexbox (http://flexbox.io/) or if you're interested in grid, he's got a free course for that too.



Don't jump straight into Frameworks such as Bootstrap or Bulma yet, wait until you are capable of building web pages on your own first. You may think a framework would save you time by doing the work for you, but these frameworks can (and will) go wrong, if you don't know how to build something yourself you won't know how to solve framework problems.



### 4. Challenge yourself.



So by now you should have a very good knowledge of HTML and CSS, but you may be wondering what to do with it.



You need to start building. There’s only one way to becoming better at what you’re doing: Keep learning, keep building.



Not just to put those skills to the test but also to build up a collection of work that you can put in a portfolio. I can guarantee you won't be able to find that crucial first Front-End developer job without one so you may as well start now.



If you need some ideas to challenge yourself, we've created a list to get you started, make sure you save your code files in a nice organised structure to make it easier when it comes to adding them to your portfolio..



a. Pick your favourite website and try to recreate it.

b. Make up a fictional business and build a website promoting it. Get images from free stock resources (not Google!) and use a lorem ipsum generator if you can't think of any text.

c. Sign up to a CSS challenge website, they'll send you free, quick to do challenges that will leave you inspired and with some cool projects to show off.

d. Find a local charity that would benefit from a website.

e. Check out http://www.csszengarden.com/ to see the power of CSS in action, and try ot create your own.



### 5. Learn basic JavaScript.



When it comes to JavaScript, you are opening a whole can of worms; there are so many frameworks it's very tricky to navigate.



Basic JavaScript, however, is essential. Get the hang of it, and you should find it much easier to pick up the frameworks.



We recommend you start with plain (or sometimes referred to as vanilla) Javascript by going thorugh the interactive Codecademy course (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript).



Once you've done that, jump straight into the wonderful JavaScript30 course by Wes Bos (https://javascript30.com/). The amazing thing about this course is it's simplicity and by the end you'll have a load of super cool project you could feature in your portfolio.



### 5.5 Learn to debug and love error messages.



Now that you're venturing into JavaScript, you'll find your need to debug error messages will rise drastically.



Error messages are super helpful, but when you are starting out, they can be terrifying! When this happens, take a deep breath and read the message carefully, they are telling you what the problem is.



The easiest way to debug any problem is to simply copy/paste your error message into Google. If your error message contains any files names, remove them, you just want what the problem is and Google won't help if you use filenames.



It is possible that Google finds almost no related (or helpful) results. Try breaking down the error code into chunks, and if that doesn't work then take a break. Walking away from your computer, getting outside for a quick walk or even a nap can help clear your mind, you may find that your error was caused by something so simple the only way to find it is with fresh eyes.



### 6. Learn jQuery.



You may have heard some rumours around the web that jQuery is dead, or just not worth learning in 2019, but that is not the case.



jQuery is a JavaScript framework that has been around for years and is extremely popular. It faces some very stiff competition these days against React, Angular and Vue, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't learn it. Almost every project you come across that was built more than five years ago will have jQuery in it, so really, you need to know it.



The best place to start is Codecademy (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-jquery) or if you prefer a video course, Udemy has an excellent one for only £10.99 (https://www.udemy.com/jquery-tutorial/).



### 7. Build a portfolio



By now you've got a number of projects under your belt and a good set of skills ready to show off, so it's time to build yourself a portfolio.



How you do this is up to you, if you want to get something up quickly with minimal effort so you can get back to learning you could look for a free or paid theme to utilise.



If you fancy a bit of a design challenge and want to make you own, go for it, you'll find some excellent inspiration here.



#### Tips for your portfolio:

a. Don't include all your mini projects, pick the best ones and the ones you're most proud of. 4 excellent projects are much better than 10 mediocre ones.

b. Use a professional domain name and email address.

c. Don't use scales to show your skillset (want to know why, read up on them here).

d. Make sure you test it on multiple devices and browsers.



### 8. Get your CV out there!



You've come a long way but you finally know the minimum you need to start applying for jobs.



Write up a CV as you would for any job but make sure that this one contains the web address for your online portfolio and a list of the new skills that you've learnt.



You may feel that you aren't ready or don't know enough but trust me, if you've followed the above steps, you are so ready. It's best to dive straight in, there is nothing better than learning on the job under the guidance of senior developer. You're learning will sky rocket so get applying to any local junior jobs in your area.



### 9. Pick a JavaScript framework.



You didn't think the learning was going to stop there did you?



Just because you're now applying for jobs doesn't mean you should stop self study so the next logical step is to choose a JavaScript framework to focus on.



The big three are React, Angular and Vue. In terms of popularity (and therefore more job opporunities) go for React.



Whichever one you choose should teach you enough basic concepts to be able to pick up the others on the go if you should ever need to.



To learn react we highly recommend Wes Bos' react for beginners course, the price is certainly worth the content. However, if the price is a little out of your budget, don't panic! Udemy has an excellent but much cheaper course (https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) by Maximilian Schwarzmuller.



Either course will put you on the right path but remember to update your resume and portfolio with your new skills.



### 10. Learn Git.



Now you've learnt to code, it's time to learn how to code efficiently.



Version control lets you keep track of changes that have been made to code over time and you can easy to revert back to an earlier version if you make a mistake. Trust me, this will save you a lot of stress and sleepless nights.



For example, if you implement a new jQuery plugin and suddenly existing features of your website stop working, instead of having to manually undo all your changes, you can roll back to a previous version and then try again with a different solution.



Git is the most widely used of these version control management systems and will be beneficial to any development job.



Don't be put out if you don't get the hang of it straight away, keep working with it (even if you have to constantly refer to a cheatsheet) and eventually it will click.



### 11. Get involved in Open Source.



Once you know Git, you'll be able to start contributing to open source projects which is a much respected feature to have on your resume and portfolio.



It can be scary getting started with this, the anxiety of other coders reviewing your code, but this is where you will learn about maintainability and efficiency. Even if you end up spending most of your time reading other peoples code, it won't be a waste of time. You will pick up good habits and practices from other developers and will gain some experience in working as team.



When you feel ready to write some code, go through issues on the repository and find one you think you can solve. Many open source projects will label easier issues as suitable for beginners, so look for those.



## Phew, you made it!



I know, it's been a long and tiring journey (even just reading this massive article) but you've finally achieved your goal of becoming a Front-End developer.



If you haven't managed to find yourself a job with all the skills listed above, dont give up. It can take hundreds of applications sometimes to find the right company with the right role and successfully navigate the interview process so please, do not give up. The right job is out there.



The important thing is that you keep learning, don't get comfortable and never stop asking questions.
