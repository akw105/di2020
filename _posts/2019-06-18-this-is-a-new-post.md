For those that don’t know, PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor and is a server-side programming language. For many years developers have been debating the place of PHP in the industry and whether it should be replaced with trendier technologies such as Node.JS or Ruby. 

It’s extremely common to see posts on web developer forums asking “Is PHP dead?” (spoiler alert - it isn’t) but if that was the case, we wouldn’t have so many CMS based websites currently online.

To be able to definitively say whether you should learn php in 2019, you should understand what php is useful for and the reasons for it’s rocky reputation within the developer community. 

## What PHP is useful for 

Anything you want to do on a server can be done with PHP. Small sites? Yep. Large-scale interactive platforms? Yep, that too!

PHP is great for blogs, brochure or magazine style websites, and e-commerce websites.  Many of the most popular CMS’s, including WordPress, Drupal, Magento and Joomla, are all built using PHP so to be able to manipulate and make the most of these platforms PHP is essential. 

By using a popular CMS, such as WordPress, it is possible to build a great looking website and get it up and running in very little time, making it the ideal choice for many freelance developers. 

But, let’s say you client comes to you with a brand new design they want, it’s totally unique and doesn’t match any prepaid theme available in the market. Well, you’re going to need PHP to create that custom theme for them. 

If you wanted to you could use PHP for the frontend in templating, however this is not really where PHP shines and there are much better templating options available. 

It’s also worth noting that PHP runs everywhere the web does. If you’re looking at cheap hosting for your project you will struggle to find one offering Python or Ruby, but you’ll definitely find one capable of running PHP which comes as default on most servers. 

## PHP’s popularity in the web development industry

With all the constant “Is PHP dead?” questions being posted in forums, it's easy to make the assumption that PHP is on the way out and disregard it altogether - but that couldn’t be more wrong. 

Every year StackOverflow host their web developer survey which shows what languages are being used and identifies trends amongst developers. The 2019 survey showed that 26.4% of developers are actively working with PHP, which isn’t surprising given that WordPress, a platform built with PHP, accounts for almost 35% of all websites. That’s a lot of PHP!

So, why all the hate?

### Poor security

Security tends to be the first topic developers shout about when trying to claim that PHP should no longer be used. Due to PHP’s quick and easy learning curve, it attracts many newer developers who could get a platform up and running without properly learning about security or how to enforce it. 

This lead to PHP’s reputation for being insecure. The problem is not with PHP itself, but with the untested, insecure platforms being put online by newer developers without fully understanding the risks of a vulnerable platform. 

PHP itself can be very secure if you take the time to learn. 

### Messy & unmaintainable code

As mentioned above, PHP’s ease of use encouraged many generations of developers to start server side programming. 

When building a feature PHP doesn’t really care how you do it, there are many ways of doing the same task which leads to a lot of very poor code supporting in perfectly working platforms. If it works, why would you change it? 

The web is full of poorly written PHP code examples but that doesn’t mean that all PHP is terribly written. To be clear, you can write really good code in PHP if you put the effort in to learn. The examples are few and far between but what you can learn from them will help you become an infinitely better web developer. 

Is PHP considered a good language? Well, it has more than its share of strange, annoying features, but so does every other language. PHP is as good as the developer writing it.

### PHP is immature

You may have heard this if you’ve been looking into PHP before, however whilst this may have been true many years ago, it certainly isn’t the case now, in 2019. 

PHP began it’s life, not as a language but as a templating engine for HTML. As it’s purpose pivoted to become the framework it is today, it had some catching up to do with already existing frameworks (hence the immature label). It has continued evolving year after year, but many developers who tried it out in the early days have not kept up to date with it, and still have an outdated opinion. 

## Why use PHP? 

It wouldn’t be fair to talk about the bad points without mentioning the good ones. 

### Easy to get started with

PHP has excellent online documentation and there are a number of good frameworks you can choose from. This makes the language relatively easy to learn and is often a developers first step into server side programming. 

There are countless forums and tutorials on various PHP methods and problems so it is usually very easy to find help should you need it.

### Flexible

PHP can be installed on any Windows, Linux or Unix server and can be integrated with a variety of databases to suit your needs and platform. 

There are no solid rules on how to build features with PHP so you’re free to code as you like. The biggest benefit to this is you'll have more solutions available to you when it comes to solving problems. 

### Solid community

A community to seek support is crucial when learning a new language, and thankfully, PHP has one of the largest. 

In fact, PHP has the 3rd Largest StackOverflow Community, and is the 5th Most Popular language on GitHub. There are plenty of forums and the documentation is an excellent reference, meaning that you’ll never have to look too far for answers to your questions. 

### No compiling required

Many programming languages need to be compiled each time a change is made in order to update what your output looks like, but not with PHP.

PHP has a very simple “refresh workflow” where you make a change to a source file, hit refresh, and instantly your changes are available. Not waiting on compilers can be a huge productivity boost when you’re working on a large scale project. 

## Is PHP good for the future?

Yes, just because there's more competition doesn’t mean PHP is instantly out of the game. 

You may hear a lot on the web from people who are strongly against PHP, but unless you’re looking in the right place you won’t hear as much from the people who are actually using it day to day. Popularity is based on how many people are using the technology, not how many people are writing angry blog posts about it.  

We can’t talk about PHP without mentioning the world's biggest website, Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg coded the original Facebook in PHP and the platform continues to use it to this day! Facebook have in fact created their own version of PHP called HHVM and have continued to support and encourage PHP growth which is excellent for the platform. 

Facebook isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, and neither is WordPress which currently runs around 35% of the web so it’s safe to say PHP is here to stay. 

## PHP job opportunities

Of course we all become developers with the hopes of landing a job, and based on the current market PHP can definitely help there. 

If you plan on working as a freelancer, PHP is one of the best skills to learn, since WordPress and other content management systems (Drupal, Joomla etc) are incredibly popular with non-technical  clients. 

If you don’t fancy the sound of freelancing that’s fine, because in the web development field there are four major players; PHP, Ruby, Python, and Javascript, with PHP holding the second rank in the list of job trends of the last 10 years, just slightly behind JavaScript.

Overall, PHP is still widely used by the majority of the web, so there is still a consistent demand for PHP developers. Many shopping cart tools have also been built with PHP, so it is a popular choice for online businesses as well.

## So, should you learn PHP in 2019?

Absolutely. 

But, don’t just learn PHP. 

PHP is as popular as it is because it’s easy for beginners to pick up but that doesn’t mean you should ignore other technologies in favour of PHP. We recommend that you should have some very solid JavaScript skills under your belt before moving onto PHP. 

Python and Ruby can be learnt later (if you want!) and by learning multiple languages you’ll find it much easier to grasp concepts and switch between languages.

There are a lot of PHP haters out there (many of them, very loud) but there are many more PHP job opportunities and the stats don’t lie. PHP is here to stay, take the time to learn it and it’ll open up a variety of opportunities for you and be an excellent first backend language to learn.
